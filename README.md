# Practical Machine Learning Project

### Assignment  
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about 
personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of 
enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, 
or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, 
forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different 
ways. More information is available from the website here: 

http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).   

The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. We may use any of the other variables to predict with. We will create a report describing how we built our model, how we used cross validation, what we think the expected out of sample error is, and why we made the choices we did. We will also use our prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
